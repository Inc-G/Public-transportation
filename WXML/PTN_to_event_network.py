def PTN_to_event_network(min_transfer,vehicle_paths,scedule,minimum_times):
    """
    Generates an event network matrix representing the slack between connected events
    in a public transport network (PTN).

    Args:
        min_transfer (list): Minimum transfer times at each station.
        vehicle_paths (list): List of paths for each vehicle, where each path is a
                              list of (start_station, end_station) tuples.
        schedule (list): List of schedules for each vehicle, where each schedule is a
                         list of arrival and departure times at each station along the path.
        minimum_times (list): List of minimum travel times for each edge in each
                              vehicle's path.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: A matrix where entry [i, j] represents the slack between
                       event j (arrival at a station) and event i (departure from a station).
                       A value of -1 indicates no direct connection.
    
    OLDER DESCRIPTION BELOW
    ----
    PTN: matrix of shape (#stations) * #(stations) whose entry (i,j) is 1 is there is a path 
    from i to j and 0 otherwise

    vehicle_paths: list of length #vehicles, whose k-th entry is the path for vehicle k.: 
    a list of 2-ples, where the 2-ple (i,j) is the path from station i to station j

    schedule_delay: list of length #vehicles, whose k-th entry is a list of 
    length 2*(#edges in path of vehicle k), and each entry is a tuple (scheduled_time, delay) 
    for vehicle k to perform the corresponding acticity.

    minimum_times: list of length #vehicles whose k-th entry is a list of length 
    2*length(#edges in path of vehicle k) - 1, and each entry is
    the minimum time for vehicle k to perform the corresponding acticity.

    Returns: event_network. A matrix M of size #sum of edges for all paths, where the entry M[a,b] 
    at row a and column b, where a is [train_2, station_2] and b is [train_1, station_1], 
    is the slack for the activity (train_1 arrives at station_1) â€”> 
    (train_2 departs at station_2) if such an activity is possible and -1 otherwise.
    This implementation is slightly different from the previous one. The columns and 
    rows are based off of deparing and arriving points for an edge in the event_network,
    rather than vertiecies like it was previously. This reduces the size of the matrix
    since every path that's not a loop has less edges than verticies. For an example,
    (1) from the notes on monday would give us (method just gives the matrix)
    
          (A,1)(A,2)(B,4)(B,2)
    (A,2)[[ 1.  1. -1.  2.]
    (A,3)[-1.  0. -1. -1.]
    (B,2)[-1.  0.  1.  1.]
    (B,5)[-1. -1. -1.  0.]]
    (not exactly like this, zero-based indexing changes some stuff)
    With the version that closes the loop giving us the same matrix.
