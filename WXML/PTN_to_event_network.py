    length 2*(#edges in path of vehicle k), and each entry is a tuple (scheduled_time, delay) 
    for vehicle k to perform the corresponding acticity.

    minimum_times: list of length #vehicles whose k-th entry is a list of length 
    2*length(#edges in path of vehicle k) - 1, and each entry is
    the minimum time for vehicle k to perform the corresponding acticity.

    Returns: event_network. A matrix M of size #events/2, where the entry M[a,b] 
    at row a and column b, where a is [train_1, station_1] and b is [train_2, station_2],

    len(path) x len(path) matrix submatrix, and then starting with 
    a_{21}(with respect to the submatrix) we will move right and down for each edge
    with the ability to wrap around to the top. For example, a 4x4 submatrix that is a 
    loop will look like this (s_n processed in order of computation):
    
    -1 -1 -1 s_7 
    s_1 s_2 -1 -1
